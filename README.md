# Tools you will need
- Node installed on your computer. You can download Node at [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Create react app requires a Node version at least 10.
- A package manager called npm. It is automatically included in your installation of Node. You need to have an npm version of at least 5.2
- A good code editor to work with our project files. I highly recommend using the editor Visual Stuido Code. You can download it as [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Build environment development
- Using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (CRA) to create a new project with typescript template
- Bundling using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- Configuring [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- Configuring [Pettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Configuring [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)

We will use CRA to create a new project quickly but we will not use the default bundle to start and build for this project. We should configure manually by Webpack to learn about it and it will help us to flexible for expansion in the future. After that, we continue to configure some things to help us to work effectively in a group.
