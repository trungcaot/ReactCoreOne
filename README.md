# Tools you will need
- Node installed on your computer. You can download Node at [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Create react app requires a Node version at least 10.
- A package manager called npm. It is automatically included in your installation of Node. You need to have an npm version of at least 5.2
- A good code editor to work with our project files. I highly recommend using the editor Visual Stuido Code. You can download it as [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
